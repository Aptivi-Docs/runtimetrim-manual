# 🏗 Building

Since this application is built with .NET, it's rather an easy process to follow. However, we still need to provide platform-specific instructions to ensure that successful builds are guaranteed.

Select your platform below:

{% content-ref url="building-on-windows.md" %}
[building-on-windows.md](building-on-windows.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="building-on-linux.md" %}
[building-on-linux.md](building-on-linux.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
