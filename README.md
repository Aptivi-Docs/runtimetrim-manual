# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Introducing you an application that lets you trim your `runtimes` folder from your .NET application build output to provide only relevant assemblies and native libraries for your OS and your architecture, RuntimeTrim!

RuntimeTrim not only facilitates this task by depending on the frozen runtime graph taken [from the .NET repo](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms/src/runtime.compatibility.json), but it also makes your build output size smaller, which increases flexibility. It also allows such .NET projects to be build-able on Launchpad.

To get started, select a page in the left pane.
